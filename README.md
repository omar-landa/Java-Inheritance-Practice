# Java-Inheritance-Practice
This was written to allow me to practice using inheritance while learning Java.

For this program, I created a superclass called 'Cake' that had fields for the Cake's 'flavor' and 'price'.
I then created 2 sublasses, 'BirthdayCake' and 'WeddingCake' that will inherit from the 'Cake' superclass.
The 'BirthdayCake' subclass had its own unique field called candles.
The 'WeddingCake' subclass has its own unique field called tiers.

Getter/Setter methods were then used to retrieve the inherited information from the superclass.

The TasteTester file allowed me to test for inheritance.
